# Applications with movies

I created this application to use it when I want to check something new about movies and cinema.

## Demo
[click here to look demo](https://react-pwa-d4fd9.firebaseapp.com/)

## Public API what I'm using:
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
